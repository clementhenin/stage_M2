"Note: in WTID there are missing values for UK and German top 10% shares; these missing values were estimated by interpolation using top 5% and top 1% series and in order to insure basic consistency with French and US series; the resulting series should be viewed as approximate and imperfect (particularly for Germany, due to the many changes in territories and imperfect data homogenity). All details are given in the formulas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
